Introduction
=============

What if I told you that the world you are experiencing is just a veil
put on your eyes to blind you?

You are The One but at one point I had to wipe your memory to protect you.
Now we need you but we need you awake and conscious of your true self. Before
erasing your memory you prepared this repository that contains the essence 
of your true identity.

As you gradually advance through the levels of this riddle you will unlock 
your knowledge of git this will help you awake.

You have to let it all go, Neo. Fear, doubt, and disbelief. Free your mind.

Git-Awakening
=============

Welcome to Git-Awakening! Inspired by [Notpron][], Git-Awakening is a puzzle
game in a Git repository; it uses the whole repository, not just the files 
within it.

Requirements
------------

The first few levels will be playable through GitHub, but you will need 
a local copy of the repo to manipulate for the rest. Obtaining a local 
copy is the first task of Level 0.

To make use of that local copy, you will also need to install [Git][].

Knowledge of how to use Git is not required; you can learn as you go.

How to play
-----------

Git-Awakening proceeds in levels. Each level has an associated level code, 
and your goal for each level is to find the code for the next level.

The starting point for each level is the branch `game/xxxxxxx/master`,
where `xxxxxxx` is the level's code. If the level requires you to switch
to a branch (e.g. `feat`), that branch will be prefixed with the level
code (i.e. `game/xxxxxxx/feat`).

Each level has a `README.md` file that contains the clue. Start there.

If a level branch has nothing in it (not even a README), then the level 
is not yet finished. See the Updates section below.

Searching man pages and the Internet for Git techniques is allowed and 
encouraged, but resist the temptation to cheat!

That said, if you need additional hints, you can find them in the 
`hints` directory on `master`. These hints are not spoilers.

Level 0
=======

Clone the repo.

Check out the next level: `levelone`

Hint
----

If you don't know how to do something, look it up! You will probably be 
able to find everything you need on the [Git website][gitdoc].
